Let's define "open tiles" as adjacent tiles that can be accessed because they're a walk way and there's no wall in between.

Mazestack then, in a way, prioritizes exploring west, then moving south, then moving east, then moving north.

This is because open tiles in the west are pushed last into the stack and are thus always on top, above southern open tiles, which are above... and so on.

Mazequeue on the otherhand first visits all open tiles of its current refence tile in a N->E->S->W order before moving to the next reference tile (in the same order). Effectively it looks like mazequeue is slowly exploring in all directions.

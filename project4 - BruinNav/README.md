# BruinNav

BruinNav is a text-based turn-by-turn navigation system for Los Angeles. It presents the shortest paths between two registered landmarks by applying the A* algorithm. The GeoSpatial data for this project was retrieved from the openstreetmap.org. This project was the final programming assignment for my Data Structures and Algorithms course at UCLA (CS 32)

## Things I learned, concepts I applied, and challenges I overcame:
* I learned how to properly manage, organize, and annotate large programs
* I developed a good mindset towards approaching huge projects: Develop incrementally and attempt to thoroughly test modules before moving on to other parts that operate on top of them.
* I applied the concepts of good data structure selection and usage of already existing algorithms for a real world problem.
  * I coded a simple Map data structure implemented as a Binary Search tree
  * I considered the optimal data structures for different kinds and usage of data (given the restrictions set by our professor)
    * Priority queues for heirarchy of nodes in A* Algorithm 
    * 
  * I implemented the A* algorithm after some self study.
